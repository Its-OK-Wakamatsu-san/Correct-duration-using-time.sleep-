# Precise time intervals using "time.sleep"

### Keyword
Python , module , method , precise , interval time , time.sleep , threading , queue , update 

## Overview
I often use 'time.sleep', but 'time.sleep' gives me an approximate time requested, but not an exact time.
By adjusting the sleep period with 'time.sleep', I can set the time interval precisely.

### Case#1
Case#1 is when using "time.sleep" , "threading", and "queue".[^1]  ã€€I'll adjust the 'time.sleep' period at the end of a series of threading processes.

### Case#2
Case#2 is when not using "threading". For example, when using "matplotlib FuncAnimation" method, I shall adjust "time.sleep" period in the " update function".
